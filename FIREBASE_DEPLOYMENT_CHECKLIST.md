## ðŸš€ Next Steps for Production

1. **Update Stripe to Live Mode:**

   ```bash
   echo "sk_live_your-live-secret-key" | firebase functions:secrets:set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

2. **Update Webhook Secret to Live:**

   ```bash
   echo "whsec_your-live-webhook-secret" | firebase functions:secrets:set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

3. **Update Stripe Dashboard:**
   - Create new webhook endpoint for live mode
   - Use the same URL: `https://asia-southeast1-b-commerce-78c1f.cloudfunctions.net/api/webhook`
   - Configure the same events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`

**Deployment completed successfully! ðŸŽ‰**  
All systems operational in `asia-southeast1` region.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### âœ… 1. Environment Configuration

- [ ] Ensure all Firebase services are configured for `asia-southeast1` region
- [ ] Update environment variables with correct region URLs:
  ```env
  VITE_API_URL=https://asia-southeast1-b-commerce-78c1f.cloudfunctions.net/api
  ```

### âœ… 2. Firebase Functions Region

- [x] Functions configured to deploy to `asia-southeast1` (updated in `functions/index.js`)
- [x] Firebase.json updated with region configuration
- [ ] Test functions locally with emulator before deployment

### âœ… 3. Stripe Configuration (Updated for Firebase Functions v6.3.2)

Firebase Functions v6.3.2 uses modern secrets management with `defineSecret`. Set up your Stripe secrets:

```bash
# Set Stripe secret key as a secret (modern v6 method)
firebase functions:secrets:set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
# When prompted, enter your Stripe secret key: sk_live_your-actual-secret-key

# Set Stripe webhook secret as a secret (modern v6 method)
firebase functions:secrets:set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
# When prompted, enter your webhook secret: whsec_your-webhook-secret

# Alternative: Set secrets in one command each
echo "sk_live_your-secret-key" | firebase functions:secrets:set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
echo "whsec_your-webhook-secret" | firebase functions:secrets:set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

- [ ] Update Stripe webhook endpoint URL to use asia-southeast1:
  ```
  https://asia-southeast1-b-commerce-78c1f.cloudfunctions.net/api/webhook
  ```

### âœ… Benefits of Firebase Functions v6.3.2:

- **Latest Technology**: Uses the most current v2 (2nd generation) architecture
- **Modern Secrets**: Secure secret management with `defineSecret()`
- **Regional Deployment**: Built-in support for asia-southeast1 region
- **Better Performance**: Enhanced Cloud Run-based infrastructure
- **Cost Optimization**: Improved resource allocation and concurrency
- **Enhanced Security**: Modern secret binding and environment isolation

### âœ… 4. Build and Deploy Commands

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install
cd functions && npm install && cd ..

# 2. Build the application
npm run build

# 3. Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy

# Or deploy incrementally:
firebase deploy --only hosting
firebase deploy --only functions
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
firebase deploy --only storage
```

### âœ… 5. Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Test payment flow with test cards
- [ ] Verify webhook is receiving events from Stripe
- [ ] Check Firebase Functions logs for any errors:
  ```bash
  firebase functions:log --follow
  ```
- [ ] Test Firestore security rules
- [ ] Verify file uploads to Firebase Storage

### âœ… 6. Performance Considerations

- [x] All services now in same region (asia-southeast1) for optimal latency
- [ ] Monitor response times after deployment
- [ ] Set up Firebase Performance Monitoring if needed

### âœ… 7. Monitoring and Alerts

- [ ] Set up Firebase Alerts for function errors
- [ ] Monitor Stripe webhook delivery in Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Check Firebase Hosting metrics

## Regional Benefits of Asia Southeast 1

1. **Lower Latency**: Reduced network latency for users in Southeast Asia
2. **Data Compliance**: Data stays within the region for regulatory compliance
3. **Service Consistency**: All Firebase services (Functions, Firestore, Storage) in same region
4. **Cost Optimization**: Potential cost savings for regional traffic

## Emergency Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

```bash
# Rollback to previous hosting version
firebase hosting:clone SOURCE_SITE_ID:SOURCE_VERSION_ID TARGET_SITE_ID

# Redeploy previous functions version
git checkout <previous-commit>
firebase deploy --only functions
```

## Notes

- Functions previously defaulted to us-central1
- All configuration files updated for asia-southeast1
- Stripe webhook URL must be updated in Stripe Dashboard
- Environment variables need manual update with new region URLs
