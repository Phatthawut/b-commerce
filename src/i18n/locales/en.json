        "biography": {
          "paragraph1": "Woody Prieb or formally Dr. Vuthiphong Priebjrivat is a rare combination of academic, corporate, political and spiritual accomplishments. Woody, as affectionately nick-named by his friends and colleagues, is currently president of Sahasavas Institute, a nonprofit public policy research institute.\n\nRegarding his educational background, Woody ranked first in Thailand’s National Examination (1970). He was awarded the King’s Scholarship (1970-1975) and later the Rockefeller Scholarship (1977-1984) to further his education in the United States. Woody received a B.S. in civil engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or MIT (1975); an M.S. in environmental engineering from Stanford University (1976); and an M.B.A. and a Ph.D. in economics and public management from the University of Chicago (1979 and 1984). He has also received numerous other awards including a Citibank International Fellowship (1992 and 1998) and a Fulbright Award (1993).\n\nWoody began his career in academics by teaching at Thailand’s prestigious Thammasat University (1977–1986) and was a visiting professor in America at the University of North Carolina (1992 and 1998). He had written extensively for academic and professional journals on topics covering economics, finance, business and public policy.\n\nIn his business career, Woody served as vice president for corporate planning at Bangkok Bank (1988–1992), the largest commercial bank in Thailand. Later, he helped found Thailand’s first credit rating agency, Thai Rating and Information Services or TRIS; and was its president for the first five years (1993–1998).",
          "paragraph2": "Over the years, he has also served in advisory capacity for many various organizations --business, government, academic and professional-- such as: the World Bank; Thai Parliament; National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB); Civil Service Commission (CSC); Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT); Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO); Padaeng Industry (zinc mining) and Asia Credit Securities (stock brokerage).\n\nAfter his success in business, Woody embarked on a new challenge: political activism. Related to this is the setting up of a public policy research institute, Sahasavas (1999). Later, he served as a member of the Thai National Legislative Assembly (2006–2008); and as president of TOT Corp, Thailand’s national telecom company (2007). During this period, he wrote a best-selling political satire, Corruptology: The Art and Science of Political Corruption (2000); along with a few political critiques on various topics, which were later compiled into a few other books.\n\nAnother important facet of his life is his deep interest in religions, spirituality and metaphysics. Coupled with his rigorous training in science, this interest culminates in a number of books concerning the interconnections between modern science and the ancient wisdom of dharma: Dharmodynamics (2004), Neodharma (2012 and 2020), Dharmoscience (2012 and 2020), Sankhara (2014 and 2020) and Nirvana (2024). These books are well received in and outside of Thailand. At present, he regularly gives talks on these topics to monks and the lay public alike, both in Thailand and overseas.\n\nYet another distinct intellectual character of Woody is his inclination to think visually. He consistently employs diagrams and pictorial symbols to help him think through and solve the many diverse problems he faces over his career --academic or professional, business or personal, political or spiritual. All these are captured in his other book titled, Draw Your Thoughts (2014). On this front, he often shares his \"visual thinking\" skills and experiences through talks, lectures and workshops."

        "shortDescription": "Modern science, without a doubt, can be regarded as the pinnacle of human intellectual pursuit. Considering its recent emergence of only four or five hundred years since Galileo or Copernicus, science certainly has made remarkable progress and impact when compared to other intellectual traditions, either religious or secular. Aside from countless products and artifacts only made possible by modern technology, our way of looking at the world is also profoundly influenced by science. With this enormous success, science has become so confident in itself (sometimes bordering on arrogance) that it tends to overlook what other intellectual or spiritual traditions --particularly the age-old wisdom of religions and metaphysics – have to say.",
        "description": "In another vein, the word dharma in Sanskrit, in its original and strictest sense, does not mean ethics or morality as commonly understood nowadays; but it means nature. The spiritual core of various eastern religions--particularly Buddhism, Taoism, Jainism and Hinduism-- is in fact the pursuit of true understanding of nature and its immutable laws in order for us to reach spiritual enlightenment and liberation. This is also the ultimate mission of science. In this sense, dharma is science; and science is dharma.",
        "additionalInfo1": "This four-book set is an effort to combine and integrate modern science and age-old dharma into one fuller body of knowledge --dharmoscience-- in order to better describe the ultimate reality of nature. In other words, this is a novel attempt to scientifically formulate dharma; and at the same time broaden the horizon of modern science beyond the confines of the material realm.",
        "additionalInfo2": "The four books making up this dharmoscience tetralogy are as follows: (1) Neodharma, (2) Dharmascience, (3) Sankhara, and (4) Nirvana. Within these books is where modern science and dharma converge.",
